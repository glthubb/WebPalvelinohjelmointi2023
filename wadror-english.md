## Web Server Programming Ruby on Rails 2023

Web server programming Ruby on Rails returned to the curriculum for fall 2022 as a wish list. People demanded more and the course is here again!

Ruby on Rails is an MVC web application framework that became very popular more than 15 years ago, the number one language of hipsters in 2006. Many big and well-known applications such as Twitter, Heroku, AirBnB and GitHub were initially programmed with Rails, some of them still rely on Rails. JavaScript-based technologies slowly ate away at Rails' popularity after 2015, however, there is still a constant need for Rails developers on the job market, but there are very few developers who can master Rails.

Try how it feels to program in a language whose prevailing design paradigm is the satisfaction of the application developer, and with an application framework that has solved the trivial but hard-to-decide issues (e.g. file names and directory structures) for you! You will also notice that, contrary to what the app developers of the new alliance think, not all apps have to be SPA, i.e. single page apps...

The long-term Rails house [Kisko](https://www.kiskolabs.com/fi/) is the partner of the course. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8THIRXnLGk) Kisko's Vesa and Antti's greetings to the course participants about why Rails is still the right technology choice for many projects in 2023.

At 15th December those who have completed the course will have a Rails-inspired evening at Kisko's premises...

The course focuses on implementing server-side functionality, the user interfaces produced in the course will be elementary. The course is not an introductory course to browser programming and user interface design, the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the course is very minor.

The scope of the course is 5 credits.

Although the content of the course is very similar to [Web-server programming Java](https://courses.helsinki.fi/fi/TKT21007/124962332), it is possible to complete both courses.

## Prerequisites

Continuing course in programming and the basics of databases. It is good to know HTML to the extent that it is covered in the course [Computer as a work tool](https://tkt-lapio.github.io/).

Participating in the course requires a good programming routine and readiness for independent study.

## Execution mode

The structure of the course deviates to some extent from the department's course standard. Only one application is made in the course (which at the end of the course will look something like [this](https://ratebeer22.fly.dev/)), the same application is made both in the theory material and in the calculators embedded in the theory. **You can't just read the theory material of the course; When following the material, you have to build an application that is supplemented along the way, because otherwise it will be impossible to do the tasks. In other words, the course must be followed steadily for the entire seven weeks.**

The course is divided into seven "weeks", i.e. the part that was done in the previous version of the course during one week. However, this course has only one deadline, 31 December 2023 at 23:59.

Each "week" is returned separately to the course's [return application](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/rails2023/). After returning one week's assignments, you can see the example answer for the week. In the following week, it is possible to continue either building your own application or take the example answer from the previous week as a basis.

Some of the tasks for the week are practically mandatory, otherwise progress stops for the week. Some of the tasks, on the other hand, are voluntary, implementations of non-critical features.

One of the most important learning goals of the course is to encourage independent information seeking. Because of this, the course material alone is not sufficient in all respects to solve the tasks. The course does not, for example, actually teach Ruby at all, each participant must acquire sufficient skills to use Ruby on their own during the course, see [Ruby instructions](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinojjemlointi2023/blob/main/web/rubyn_perusteita-english.md)

## Evaluation criteria

The course grade is based on the number of assignments returned. A grade of 1 requires 50% of the assignments and a grade of 5 approximately 90% of the assignments. There is no exam in the course.

The deadline for course assignments is December 31, 2023 at 11:59 p.m.

After completing the course, [register](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinojjelmointi2023/blob/main/web/ilmoittauminning-english.md) for the course implementation of the open university and [request a completion note](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinojjelmointi2023/blob/main/web/ilmoittauminen.md#pr√∏wtusmerkinn%C3%A4n-pyyt%C3%A4minen) in the recovery application.

## Editor/IDE

Rails support can be found in most development environments. Since Ruby is a dynamically typed, interpreted language, the support of development environments (e.g. automatic coding) is not nearly the same as when programming with Java, for example.

The "best" Rails development environment at the moment is RubyMine developed by Jetbrains http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/
The program is paid, but everyone with an @helsinki-email address gets a student license for free [from the JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)

Several text editors, e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) also offer reasonable Rails support.
